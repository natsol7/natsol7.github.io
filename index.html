About Architectural Design-III </a><br><br>
June 28<sup>th</sup> 2019. Addis Ababa/Ethiopia.
    <p>
       The following Images contain materials of Nathnael Solomon's third Year design works. <br><br>
       The Design is Based in the Cherkos area of Kirkos Subcity. Cherkos Sefer is a sefer located in the slum areas 
       mostly occupied by "Shiftas" or Bandits in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century. <br>Since then it has evolved into a 
       mass housing or mass residential area. A "Sefer" is an Amharic term which most closely translates to Settlement, 
       and basically means "A Neighborhood"... but smaller. <br><br>
       After analysing the site in various levels, the findings indicated that the low income style of residence kindled 
       a closeness and intimacy between neighbors, thus resulting in very little sense of privacy and most things being
       shared, and activities being done on the streets. <br><br>
       However, while this intimacy has resulted in a closeness amongst kin, it has also resulted in unwanted disputes 
       resulting from improper demarcation of Territory. <br><br> 
       That is the very least, not to mention the dangers the Youth would be exposed to when sharing these same streets
       as the ones that vicious hounds and narcotics dealers would be stalking.<br><br> 
       Amidst the Grind and Hustle, which is so very real, the proposed design attempts to intervene in a manner centered
       around the predominant Youth, all the while consulting residents from all walks of life, age groups and corners of 
       the neighborhood whilst paying respect to it's sacred foundations passed down from generations.
